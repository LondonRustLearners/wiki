# Website / Wiki

This website is generated from Markdown files in a normal 
Github repository. If you'd like to participate, ask
to be added as a member of [this Github
organization](https://github.com/LondonRustLearners) (contact
[Christian](mailto:chrjae@gmail.com) if there's no obvious way to
request it from the Github website), you can then edit the wiki pages,
or create new repositories within the group. (Alternatively you can fork 
this repository then send pull requests without being member (yet).)

The website updates automatically every 10 minutes from Github. You
can also trigger a sync earlier by pressing the sync button (top right
corner of the page).
