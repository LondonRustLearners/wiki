# Website / Wiki

This website is generated from Markdown files in a normal Github
repository, which you can reach by clicking the "history" or "edit"
links near the top right corner of each page.

For editing you need to be member of [our Github
organization](https://github.com/LondonRustLearners). Ask
[Christian](mailto:chrjae@gmail.com) if there's no obvious way to
request membership from the Github website (TODO check how it works).

(Alternatively you can fork this repository then send pull requests
without being member (yet).)

The website updates automatically every 10 minutes from Github. You
can also trigger a sync earlier by pressing the sync button (top right
corner of the page).
