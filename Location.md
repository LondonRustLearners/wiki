## Our London location

We are being hosted by Skills Matter and are (currently) using the tables in the lobby.

### Possible alternatives

Possible alternative locations might be:

* the meeting room at the [London
  Hackspace](https://london.hackspace.org.uk/) -> will be too small
  for us. (It's also rather noisy.)

## The UK Outside London

Our current group is based in London, but if you're interested in
creating another group somewhere else in the UK you're more than
welcome to add your pages here, and/or we can also add subdomains of
rustaceans.uk for you, or rework the site if needed (e.g. have our
part on london.rustaceans.uk). Just write to our mailing list or
contact [Christian](users/Christian_Jaeger.md).
