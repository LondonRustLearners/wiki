# Rust learning and hacking group

We are a bunch of hackers in [the UK (London)](Location.md) learning and
improving in the use of the [Rust programming
language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

We meet up once a month at CodeNode of Skills Matter (usually last
Monday in the month?, usually from 6:30/7 PM) to learn and to work on
projects. We've got [a Github organization](Github.md) where we can
store common materials/results. And we've got our very own IRC channel `#rustaceans.uk` on [irc.mozilla.org](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC)


## Our next meeting

**Thursday, August 31, 2017**, 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM at Code Node (Skills Matter). Please register with Skills matter [here](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/9882-rust-learning-and-hacking-evening-2). (This event is also on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/events/242378000/).)

[Past events](past_events/index.md)

## Activities

We are doing the following in parallel sub-groups:

 *   Get a minimal fluency in Rust, by working through [the Rust
     book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (online). Christian will try
     to make this a smooth experience, but keep in mind that this is not
     a course, but a co-learning experience. We're in it together. We'll
     build groups of ~3 people each to work through the material; if a
     group is stuck, they'll ask the other groups or if unsuccessful see
     whether they can get tips from Rustaceans working on projects.

     Other ideas:

    * [rustlings (learning Rust through snippets)](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings)
    * go through the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) and implement it in Rust

 *  Working on projects: in pairs, teams, or alone; even if you're
    working alone, you may find it beneficial to have other Rustaceans
    around. We might also reserve time for asking questions to the
    plenum.

    Active teams:

    * [libbluez.rs](http://github.com/khvzak/libbluez-rs) by member
      Aleksandr
    * a web-crawler (crawler.rs?) <!--(url XXX)--> (experimental) by member Alex
    * orientdb by member ...<!--XXX-->
    * <!--XXX project name and URL?-->a [Redis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis) module
      wrapper for Redis modules in Rust (correct?) by member Anthony

    Do you have a project in C/C++ that you're pondering to rewrite in Rust?

    Also check [project ideas](Project_ideas.md). If you stumble on
    an interesting project please add it there even if you don't
    intend to work on it yourself during the evenings.

At each event we'll first (at 7:00 PM) give a quick overview on what's
going on so that new attendants can decide which sub-group to
join. Also, after the event we'll add a summary about the status of
each sub-group to the wiki here.


## Possible future activities

Some ideas we might pick up if deemed useful:

  * Help/tutoring: we can try to enable people with a question that
    deserves answering by an (intermediate) expert, or discussion by
    the group, to come forward and find such an expert or set up a
    discussion. E.g. (fictional example) someone finds there are
    mysteries around interactive debugging of Rust programs, come
    forward ask whether anyone is around who feels up to answering the
    questions or give a tutorial, if there is nobody, we could try to
    find someone who researches the topic for another time and will
    then present it.

  * Code Dojo (which means, decide at the start of the evening what to
    figure out or write, elect someone to type at a common screen,
    everybody pitches in with steps helping to solve it). We could do
    these at some regular Rust user group meetings in the classroom
    instead, though.
