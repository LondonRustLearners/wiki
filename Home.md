# Rust learning and hacking group

We are a bunch of hackers in [the UK (London)](Location.md) learning and
improving in the use of the [Rust programming
language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

We meet once a month at CodeNode of Skills Matter (usually last
Monday in the month?, usually from 6:30/7 PM) to learn and to work on
projects. We've got [a Github organization](Github.md) where we can
store common materials/results.


## Our next and first meeting

Monday January 30 at 7 PM, in the [Esc](https://skillsmatter.com/event-space)ape at CodeNode, 10 South Place, London, EC2M 7EB. 

We will meet up from 6:30 PM for socializing and preparing and start the learning activity at 7 PM. We'll have to leave the space around 9:30 PM (so we don't have much time, really!)

Join the discussion on the [Rust London User Group meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/).


## Activities

We plan to do the following in sub-groups working in parallel:

* Get a minimal fluency in Rust, by working through [the Rust
  book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (online).
    * Another idea: [rustlings (learning Rust through snippets)](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings)

* Working on projects: in pairs, teams, or alone; even if you're
  working alone, you may find it beneficial to have other Rustaceans
  around. We might also reserve time for asking questions to the plenum.

    * various projects suitable to work on in small teams. 

        * implementation of security sensitive system libraries and
          programs like a DHCP client (leader: ?)
        * work on parts of [Redox OS](http://www.redox-os.org/)
          ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10295187)) (leader: [Jasper](users/Jasper_Wallace.md)?)

      Please add new active projects above (and link to their project
      page), and if you've got a leader then please mention him/her.

    * personal projects. Mention your project and your name
      here if you're interested in letting the others know and welcome
      potential contributions!

        * ...

* Code Dojo (which means, decide at the start of the evening what to
  figure out or write, elect someone to type at a common screen,
  everybody pitches in with help how to solve it): not currently
  active, but perhaps as a continuation after we're done with the
  book?


At each event we'll first (at 7:00 PM) give a quick overview on what's
going on so that new attendants can decide which sub-group to
join. Also, after the event we'll add a summary about the status of
each sub-group to the wiki here.
