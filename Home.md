# Rust learning and hacking group

We are a bunch of hackers in [the UK (London)](Location.md) learning and
improving in the use of the [Rust programming
language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

We meet up once a month at CodeNode of Skills Matter (usually last
Monday in the month?, usually from 6:30/7 PM) to learn and to work on
projects. We've got [a Github organization](Github.md) where we can
store common materials/results. And we've got our very own IRC channel `#rustaceans.uk` on [irc.mozilla.org](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC)

*We're still working on the layout for this website. Hopefully we can make it both well readable* and *visually appealing.*


## Our next and first meeting

Monday January 30 at 7 PM, in the [Esc](https://skillsmatter.com/event-space)ape at CodeNode, 10 South Place, London, EC2M 7EB. 

We will meet up from 6:30 PM for socializing and preparing and will start the learning activity at 7 PM. We'll have to leave the space around 9:30 PM (so we don't have much time, really!)

Join the discussion on the [Rust London User Group meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/).


## Activities

We plan to do the following in sub-groups working in parallel:

* Get a minimal fluency in Rust, by working through [the Rust
  book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (online).
    * Another idea: [rustlings (learning Rust through snippets)](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings)

* Working on projects: in pairs, teams, or alone; even if you're
  working alone, you may find it beneficial to have other Rustaceans
  around. We might also reserve time for asking questions to the plenum.

    * various projects suitable to work on in small teams. Have a look
      at [project ideas](Project_ideas.md). Add here if you're
      dedicated going forward with a project.

        * ...

    * personal projects. Mention your project and your name
      here if you're interested in letting the others know and welcome
      potential contributions!

        * ...

* Code Dojo (which means, decide at the start of the evening what to
  figure out or write, elect someone to type at a common screen,
  everybody pitches in with steps helping to solve it): not currently
  active, but perhaps as a continuation after we're done with the
  book? (We might be holding these at the Rust user group meetings in
  the classroom instead, though.)


At each event we'll first (at 7:00 PM) give a quick overview on what's
going on so that new attendants can decide which sub-group to
join. Also, after the event we'll add a summary about the status of
each sub-group to the wiki here.
