# Rust learning and hacking group

We are a bunch of hackers in [the UK (London)](Location.md) learning and
improving in the use of the [Rust programming
language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

We meet up once a month at CodeNode of Skills Matter (usually last
Monday in the month?, usually from 6:30/7 PM) to learn and to work on
projects. We've got [a Github organization](Github.md) where we can
store common materials/results. And we've got our very own IRC channel `#rustaceans.uk` on [irc.mozilla.org](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC)

<small>*We're still working on the layout for this website. Hopefully we can make it both well readable* and *visually appealing.*</small>


## Our next and first meeting

Monday January 30 at 6:30/7 PM, in the [Alt/Tab](https://skillsmatter.com/event-space) room at CodeNode, 10 South Place, London, EC2M 7EB. 

We will meet up from 6:30 PM for socializing and preparing and will start the official activities at 7 PM. We'll have to leave the space around 9:30 PM (so we don't have much time, really!)

The learning group will go through the chapters "Getting started" and as much of "Tutorial: Guessing Game" as we manage (except if everybody is further ahead already and we decide to jump forward). Christian will offer access to a server with Rust already installed for those who don't have it working on their own machine.

The attendants wanting to work on team projects will hold and listen to pitches on which projects they would like to or could work on and why those are suited, will build the teams, then start work.

Join the discussion on the Rust London User Group [meetup event page](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/events/237073865/).


## Activities

We plan to do the following in sub-groups working in parallel:

* Get a minimal fluency in Rust, by working through [the Rust
  book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (online). Christian will try
  to make this a smooth experience, but keep in mind that this is not
  a course, but a co-learning experience. We're in it together. We'll
  build groups of ~3 people each to work through the material; if a
  group is stuck, they'll ask the other groups or if unsuccessful see
  whether they can get tips from Rustaceans working on projects.

    * Another idea: [rustlings (learning Rust through snippets)](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings)

* Working on projects: in pairs, teams, or alone; even if you're
  working alone, you may find it beneficial to have other Rustaceans
  around. We might also reserve time for asking questions to the plenum.

    * various projects suitable to work on in small teams. Have a look
      at [project ideas](Project_ideas.md). Add here if you're
      dedicated going forward with a project.

        * ...

    * personal projects. Mention your project and your name
      here if you're interested in letting the others know and welcome
      potential contributions!

        * ...

* Code Dojo (which means, decide at the start of the evening what to
  figure out or write, elect someone to type at a common screen,
  everybody pitches in with steps helping to solve it): not currently
  active, but perhaps as a continuation after we're done with the
  book? (We might be holding these at the Rust user group meetings in
  the classroom instead, though.)


At each event we'll first (at 7:00 PM) give a quick overview on what's
going on so that new attendants can decide which sub-group to
join. Also, after the event we'll add a summary about the status of
each sub-group to the wiki here.
