# Welcome

We are a bunch of hackers learning and improving in the use of the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Our current group is based in London, but if you're interested in
creating another group somewhere else in the UK you're more than
welcome to add your pages here, and we can also add subdomains of
rustaceans.uk if that suits you. Just write to our mailing list or
contact [Christian](users/Christian_Jaeger.md).

We meet once a month at Skills Matter (usually last Monday in the
month?, usually from 7 PM) to learn and work on projects. We've got [a
Github organization](https://github.com/LondonRustLearners/) where we
can store common materials/results.<!-- XXX sep wiki page on that topic? well Wiki.md page?-->  <!-- XXX mention mailing list + IRC -->


## Activities

The place can be used freely however you like, although we concentrate
on the following by grouping up, with separate sub-groups working in
parallel on separate tables:

* Get a minimal fluency in Rust, by working through [the Rust
  book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (online).
    * Another idea: [rustlings (learning Rust through snippets)](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings)

* Working on various projects in small teams. 

    * implementation of security sensitive system libraries and
      programs like a DHCP client (leader: ?)
    * work on parts of [Redox OS](http://www.redox-os.org/)
      ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10295187)) (leader: ?)

  Please add new active projects above (and link to their project
  page), and if you've got a leader then please mention him/her.

* Working on personal projects. Mention your project and your name
  here if you're interested in letting the others know and welcome
  contributions!

    * ...

* Code Dojo (which means, decide at the start of the evening what to
  figure out or write, elect someone to type at a common screen,
  everybody pitches in with help how to solve it): not currently
  active, but perhaps as a continuation after we're done with the
  book?
