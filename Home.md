# Rust learning and hacking groups

We are a number of groups of hackers in the UK and abroad learning and
improving in the use of the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

We've got [a Github organization](Github.md) where we can store common
materials/results, and the IRC channel `#rustaceans.uk` on
[irc.mozilla.org](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC)

We're currently 3 groups, which have their own area on this website:

* [London](London/index.md)
* Cambridge
* [Rome](Rome/index.md)

<!-- ^- add link to your subdirectory once ready -->


## Our next meeting

On **Thursday, August 31, 2017**, the London, Cambridge and Rome
groups will all hold learning and hacking events around the same
time. We will try to get in contact via video conferencing (using
Google Hangouts) around the beginning of the event to say hi and maybe
say a few words about what we're doing, and then again towards the end
of the event to wrap up and tell about any special occurrences. During
the evening we all use the IRC channel (see above) for asking or
leaving random thoughts about the whole setting.

* The London event is happening **6:30 to 9:00 PM (British time) at Code
Node** (Skills Matter) (in Alt/Tab?). Please register with Skills matter
[here](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/9882-rust-learning-and-hacking-evening-2). This
[event is also on meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/events/242378000/). See
our [project list](London/Projects.md) (get your project onto it!).

* The Rome event is happening **7:30 to 10:00 PM (Italian time) at Fusolab 2.0** (to be confirmed). Please register with [here](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Roma/events/242709171/).

The Cambridge event: XXX

## Activities

We are doing the following in parallel sub-groups:

* Get a minimal fluency in Rust, by working through
    [the Rust book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (online), or other
    ideas:

    * [rustlings (learning Rust through snippets)](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings)
    * go through the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) and implement it in Rust
    * [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/)
    * [hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

    Keep in mind that this is not a course, but a co-learning
    experience. You'll group up with other people (about 2-5 each) to
    work through the material; if your group is stuck, ask the other
    groups or see whether you can get tips from Rustaceans working on
    projects, or via the IRC channel, or ask the organizers for help.

* Working on projects: in pairs, teams, or alone; even if you're
    working alone, you may find it beneficial to have other Rustaceans
    around. You can also ask questions on the IRC channel, or ask us
    to ask the question to the plenum.

    See the list of projects:

    * [London](London/Projects.md)

    Also check [project ideas](Project_ideas.md). If you stumble on
    an interesting project please add it there even if you don't
    intend to work on it yourself during the evenings.

At each event we'll first give a quick overview on what's going on so
that new attendants can decide which sub-group to join. Also, after
the event we'll add a summary about the status of each sub-group to
the wiki here.


## Possible future activities

Some ideas we might pick up if deemed useful:

  * Help/tutoring: we can try to enable people with a question that
    deserves answering by an (intermediate) expert, or discussion by
    the group, to come forward and find such an expert or set up a
    discussion. E.g. (fictional example) someone finds there are
    mysteries around interactive debugging of Rust programs, come
    forward ask whether anyone is around who feels up to answering the
    questions or give a tutorial, if there is nobody, we could try to
    find someone who researches the topic for another time and will
    then present it.

  * Code Dojo (which means, decide at the start of the evening what to
    figure out or write, elect someone to type at a common screen,
    everybody pitches in with steps helping to solve it). We could do
    these at some regular Rust user group meetings in the classroom
    instead, though.
