# Rust learning and hacking group

We are a bunch of hackers learning and improving in the use of the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Our current group is based in London, but if you're interested in
creating another group somewhere else in the UK you're more than
welcome to add your pages here, and we can also add subdomains of
rustaceans.uk if that suits you. Just write to our mailing list or
contact [Christian](users/Christian_Jaeger.md).

We meet once a month at CodeNode from Skills Matter (usually last
Monday in the month?, usually from 7 PM) to learn and to work on
projects. We've got [a Github organization](Github.md) where we can
store common materials/results.

## Our next and first meeting

Monday January 30 at 7 PM, in the Escape at CodeNode, 10 South Place, London, EC2M 7EB. 

We will meet up from 6:30 PM for socializing and preparing and start the learning activity at 7 PM.

## Activities

We plan to do the following in sub-groups, with separate sub-groups
working in parallel on separate tables:

* Get a minimal fluency in Rust, by working through [the Rust
  book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (online).
    * Another idea: [rustlings (learning Rust through snippets)](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings)

* Working on various projects in small teams. 

    * implementation of security sensitive system libraries and
      programs like a DHCP client (leader: ?)
    * work on parts of [Redox OS](http://www.redox-os.org/)
      ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10295187)) (leader: [Jasper](users/Jasper_Wallace.md)?)

  Please add new active projects above (and link to their project
  page), and if you've got a leader then please mention him/her.

* Working on personal projects. Mention your project and your name
  here if you're interested in letting the others know and welcome
  contributions!

    * ...

* Code Dojo (which means, decide at the start of the evening what to
  figure out or write, elect someone to type at a common screen,
  everybody pitches in with help how to solve it): not currently
  active, but perhaps as a continuation after we're done with the
  book?

We may also find it useful to quickly (!, time will be short) discuss
what's going on in each sub-group at the start of the evening.


## Links

* [Rust London User
  Group](http://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/) (meetup.com)
  used for organization of our meetup dates, as well as the regular
  evenings with talks.
