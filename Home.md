# Rust learning and hacking group

We are a bunch of hackers in [the UK (London)](Location.md) learning and
improving in the use of the [Rust programming
language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

We meet up once a month at CodeNode of Skills Matter (usually last
Monday in the month?, usually from 6:30/7 PM) to learn and to work on
projects. We've got [a Github organization](Github.md) where we can
store common materials/results. And we've got our very own IRC channel `#rustaceans.uk` on [irc.mozilla.org](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC)


## Our next meeting

**Thursday, August 31, 2017**, 6:30 to 9:00 PM at Code Node (Skills Matter) (in Alt/Tab?). Please register with Skills matter [here](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/9882-rust-learning-and-hacking-evening-2). (This event is also on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/events/242378000/).)

If you have already decided upon a project that you're going to work on, send [Christian](mailto:chrjae@gmail.com) an email with project name, project/Github URL or what the project is about, and whether you are the project initiator, and what name and email address you'd like to have published if not those from your "From" address ASAP; Christian will add it to the [project list](Projects.md), so that interested collaborators can inform themselves in advance, and go through the list at the start of the event asking where you are, so that it is easy for them to find you.

([Past events](past_events/index.md))

## Activities

We are doing the following in parallel sub-groups:

   * Get a minimal fluency in Rust, by working through [the Rust
     book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (online). Christian will try
     to make this a smooth experience, but keep in mind that this is not
     a course, but a co-learning experience. We're in it together. We'll
     build groups of ~3 people each to work through the material; if a
     group is stuck, they'll ask the other groups or if unsuccessful see
     whether they can get tips from Rustaceans working on projects.

     Other ideas:

    * [rustlings (learning Rust through snippets)](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings)
    * go through the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) and implement it in Rust

  * Working on projects: in pairs, teams, or alone; even if you're
    working alone, you may find it beneficial to have other Rustaceans
    around. You can also ask questions on the IRC channel, or ask us
    to ask the question to the plenum.

    See the list of [Projects](Projects.md). Add your project to it
    (send email).

    Also check [project ideas](Project_ideas.md). If you stumble on
    an interesting project please add it there even if you don't
    intend to work on it yourself during the evenings.

At each event we'll first (at 7:00 PM) give a quick overview on what's
going on so that new attendants can decide which sub-group to
join. Also, after the event we'll add a summary about the status of
each sub-group to the wiki here.


## Possible future activities

Some ideas we might pick up if deemed useful:

  * Help/tutoring: we can try to enable people with a question that
    deserves answering by an (intermediate) expert, or discussion by
    the group, to come forward and find such an expert or set up a
    discussion. E.g. (fictional example) someone finds there are
    mysteries around interactive debugging of Rust programs, come
    forward ask whether anyone is around who feels up to answering the
    questions or give a tutorial, if there is nobody, we could try to
    find someone who researches the topic for another time and will
    then present it.

  * Code Dojo (which means, decide at the start of the evening what to
    figure out or write, elect someone to type at a common screen,
    everybody pitches in with steps helping to solve it). We could do
    these at some regular Rust user group meetings in the classroom
    instead, though.
