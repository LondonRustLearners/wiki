# London group

We meet up once a month at CodeNode of Skills Matter (usually last
Monday in the month?, usually from 6:30 PM) to learn and to work on
projects.

Our next meeting will be at the same time as Cambridge and Rome
events, see [Home](../Home.md).


If you have already decided upon a project you're going to work on, get this mentioned 

send [Christian](mailto:chrjae@gmail.com) an email with project name,
project/Github URL or what the project is about, and whether you are
the project initiator, and what name and email address you'd like to
have published if not those from your "From" address ASAP; Christian
will add it to the [project list](Projects.md), so that interested
collaborators can inform themselves in advance, and go through the
list at the start of the event asking where you are, so that it is
easy for them to find you.
