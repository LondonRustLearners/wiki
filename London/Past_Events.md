## Monday September 18: Rust learning and hacking evening #3

### Announcement

Please register with our host Skills Matter
[here](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/9938-rust-learning-and-hacking-evening-3). This
[event is also on meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/events/243263150/).

### Wrap-up

*(by Christian)*

We were allocated a room with tables in a class room configuration (everybody looking to the front), perhaps because I didn't specify our needs explicitly this time, so I asked whether this could be changed and Skills Matter gave us a meeting style room instead. This room was worryingly small though and in fact we used up every single chair (17 people). I'll make our needs clear in advance next time.

Interestingly, on this evening we had many attendants who had not come before (not even a talk event), it was about half new people and half previous attendants.

This time nobody submitted a new project, I guess I should stop trying to keep an always-up-to-date list, and instead just aim to maintain one single list regardless of whether project leaders come in for the next event or not. I'm also not sure how many projects had contributors so far, it seems people mostly work on their own but use the event to chat about what they are doing?

I mostly let the event run by itself this time. Partially because of that, this was the first meeting where I really got around learning new stuff myself (other than just caring about the organization). I had a pretty great time.

[Jasper](../users/Jasper_Wallace.md) confirmed with Skills Matter that it's OK to eat our own food, and ordered a couple pizzas and other food on his own initiative since nobody came forward and I didn't lead this properly. Thanks, Jasper! Sadly he ended up taking most food home with him. I think next time we should make a short list of suggestions for ordering including their price and ask for a show-hands for each of them before placing the order. Anyone else interested in handling this?

Again everybody seems to have been happy, in spite of me not really knowing what I'm doing. But perhaps that's an illusion, please tell if anything didn't work as you had hoped!


## Thursday August 31 2017: Rust learning and hacking evening #2

This was an event shared with the groups in Cambridge and Rome, see [here](../../past_shared_events/shared-1.md).

## Monday January 30 2017: Rust learning and hacking evening #1

### Announcement

Monday January 30 at 6:30/7 PM at CodeNode, 10 South Place, London, EC2M 7EB. 

We will meet up from 6:30 PM for socializing and preparing and will start the official activities at 7 PM. We'll have to leave the space around 9:30 PM (so we don't have much time, really!)

The learning group will go through the chapters "Getting started" and as much of "Tutorial: Guessing Game" as we manage (except if everybody is further ahead already and we decide to jump forward). Christian will offer access to a server with Rust already installed for those who don't have it working on their own machine.

The attendants wanting to work on team projects will hold and listen to pitches on which projects they would like to or could work on and why those are suited, will build the teams, then start work.

Join the discussion on the Rust London User Group [meetup event page](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/events/237073865/), and please register for the event at [Skills Matter's event page](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/9012-rust-learning-and-hacking-evening-1).

### Wrap-up

*(by Christian)*

We had 62 final RSVPs on meetup.com (after reaching up to 76(?) of
the 80 places), 35 registrations on Skills Matter (of which 12 don't
have usernames resembling users on meetup.com, thus max 12 additional
registrations (although guests on meetup.com count as RSVPs there but
aren't listed, and for one registration the corresponding RSVP was
cancelled)), and 42 actual attendants on the evening.

I arrived late at 6:36 (sorry again about that, preparations had taken
a lot of time in the 2 weeks prior, and I was scrambling to get the
last steps done before arriving). Skills Matter gave us a different
room than planned, probably because they had only 35 registrations
(versus the 60+ RSVPs on meetup.com that I told them about when asking
for the room), most attendants had already arrived. Originally we were
allocated the tables in the hall and socializing there would have been
very natural, I hadn't thought about how this would change when we
were given a room instead. Seems you all weren't all too bored though,
while I was hooking up a Raspberry Pi since there were only digital
connectors for the presentation and my Laptop has only VGA.
