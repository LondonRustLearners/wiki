# Things to say on each meetup

* who is who and working on what?

* who wants to join a project? Everybody knows what to do tonight? (Can always move mid-evening, too.)

* join the IRC channel, and know about the website/wiki/Github!

* ordering food? Make list.

    * NOTE: announce choices via meetup comment before the meetup, perhaps.

* we need to leave at 9 PM, so we wrap up at 8:50 PM. Let's take a break ~7:45-7:50 PM to move the legs, grab a beer or cider, or just continue coding or learning.

* wrap up:

    * maybe we do have things to say about what we found out, or what we *didn't* find out, etc.
    * if we don't, because it takes time to digest, remember, can write it up afterwards in the wiki!

## Maybe say

* present something from time to time, micro presentations. (*Could* be on an evening shared with other groups via conferencing)

    * projects
    * things figured out
    * how to do this and that
