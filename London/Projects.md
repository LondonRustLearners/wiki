# Projects of the London group

## Planned on the next meetup

*Send [Christian](mailto:chrjae@gmail.com) an email with project name, project/Github URL or what the project is about, and whether you are the project initiator, and what name and email address you'd like to have published if not those from your "From" address ASAP; Christian will add it here, so that interested collaborators can inform themselves in advance, and will go through the list at the start of the event asking where you are, so that it is easy for them to find you. (Alternatively add it yourself, see [Github](../Github.md).)*

...(your entry here; if it already has an entry in the previous meetups (see below), please copy it back here)

*See [project ideas](../Project_ideas.md) for more ideas which may not have any takers yet.*


### Mentors

We're here for learning, and that means that we can get stuck. Help us get unstuck by mentoring! By volunteering as an official contact during the evening you can enjoy the feeling of helping others, test your knowledge (remember, you only understand something fully once you've been teaching it to others!), and get good karma! You can still work on your own things when there are no questions, and you don't need to do it again in the future. Just hang out in our IRC channel, and people with unsolved questions will ask them there. Add your IRC nickname to the list below so that questioners can "ping" you.

* [Peter](https://github.com/pedrosland) is working on Rust bindings for the Raspberry Pi cam

## Projects on previous meetups

Feel free to copy your project from here into the list above again!

### On the [second evening](past_events/evening-2.md)

* [Rosario](https://github.com/veganpower): make a [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) wrapper that uses Rust's features to guarantee correctness.

* [Karl Hobley](https://github.com/kaedroho): work on [RocksDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RocksDB) [bindings](https://github.com/spacejam/rust-rocksdb), [Lyon](https://github.com/nical/lyon) or [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez).

* [Niels Egberts](https://github.com/nielsegberts/): [Rust-Monzo](https://github.com/nielsegberts/rust-monzo), a wrapper around the [Monzo bank API](https://duckduckgo.com/html/?q=Monzo%20api) (Monzo did announce that this version of the API is not going to get updates anymore (they'll make a new one next year), but in the meantime it will keep working for developers.)

* [booyaa](https://github.com/booyaa/): will be triaging [RLS](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls) issues.

* [Wojciech](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/members/230502258/) is considering porting a window manager like dwm (or something else from [suckless.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suckless.org))

* [Michael Killough](https://github.com/mjkillough) will probably work on [Cnx](https://github.com/mjkillough/cnx), a simple bar for use with simple window managers, or some [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy) issues, or perhaps polish [Lanta](https://github.com/mjkillough/lanta) into something others could use.

*Also note the [Rome](../Rome/Projects.md) and [Cambridge](../Cambridge/Projects.md) project pages.*
