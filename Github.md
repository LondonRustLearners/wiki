# Github organization

Become a member of [our Github
organization](https://github.com/LondonRustLearners), then you can
upload your project files or save wiki edits directly. Ask
[Christian](mailto:chrjae@gmail.com) (TODO: CGI).

## Website / Wiki

This website is generated from Markdown files in a normal Github
repository, which you can reach by clicking the "history" or "edit"
links near the top right corner of each page. If you're not a member
of the Github organization yet, then Github lets you save to a fork
and then send a pull request, which is fine, too.

The website updates automatically every 10 minutes from Github. You
can also trigger a sync earlier by pressing the sync button (top right
corner of the page).

You can also create new pages, they will automatically appear in the
navigation bar shown on the website (in a pretty random position,
though, ask [Christian](mailto:chrjae@gmail.com) to change this in the
configuration).
