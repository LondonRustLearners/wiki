# Github organization

Become a member of [our Github
organization](https://github.com/LondonRustLearners), then you can
upload your project files or save wiki edits directly. Ask
[Christian](mailto:chrjae@gmail.com) (TODO: CGI).

## Website / Wiki

This website is generated from Markdown files in the [wiki repository
in our Github
organization](https://github.com/LondonRustLearners/wiki/). By
clicking the "history" or "edit" links near the top right corner of
each page you are directed to that repository. If you're not a member
of the Github organization yet, then Github lets you save to a fork
and then send a pull request, which is fine, too (Christian will merge
the change).

The website updates automatically every 10 minutes from Github. You
can also trigger a sync earlier by pressing the sync button (top right
corner of the page).

You can also create new pages, they will automatically appear in the
navigation bar shown on the website (in a pretty random position,
though, ask [Christian](mailto:chrjae@gmail.com) to change this in the
configuration).
