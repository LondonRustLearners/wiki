# Projects of the Rome group

## Planned on the next meetup

*Send [Claudio](mailto:wbigger@gmail.com) an email with project name, project/Github URL or what the project is about, and whether you are the project initiator, and what name and email address you'd like to have published if not those from your "From" address ASAP; Claudio will add it here, so that interested collaborators can inform themselves in advance, and will go through the list at the start of the event asking where you are, so that it is easy for them to find you. (Alternatively add it yourself, see [Github](../Github.md).)*

* [rust-android-tutorial](https://github.com/wbigger/rust-android-tutorial), a tutorial to use openGL in Android with Rust, by Claudio Capobianco - the compiled version of this tutorial is available [here](https://wbigger.github.io/rust-android-tutorial/). This work is based on [android-rs-glue](https://github.com/tomaka/android-rs-glue), by tomaka.

* [web-playground](https://github.com/RustRome/web-playground)  Let's play with Rocket/ Gotham / Iron by Enrico Risa.

* [songkick-api](https://github.com/RustRome/songkick-api) Switch this songkick client library to the latest version of hyper with async I/O, by Enrico Risa.
