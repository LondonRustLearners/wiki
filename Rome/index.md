# Rome group

We meet up once a month at LUISS EnLabs (Stazione Termini, Rome), in the frame of Codemotion Aperitech, at 7:00 PM. As the name suggests, a light aperitif is offered by Codemotion ;)

Next meeting will be **November 8, 2017**.

Third evening of hack and learning with Rust! As usual, we will work in two groups, one for personal/group project and one for exercises.
