# Rome group

We meet up once a month at LUISS EnLabs, in the frame of Codemotion Aperitech.
We meet usually the second (?) Wednesday of the month, at 7:00 PM.

Our next meeting is a little exception, since
it will be at the same time as Cambridge and Rome
events, see [Home](http://rustaceans.uk/). This event will be hosted by **[Fusolab](http://www.fusolab.net/) (to be confirmed!)**

* See our [project list](Projects.md)--get your project onto the list!
