# Rome group

We meet up once a month at LUISS EnLabs, in the frame of Codemotion Aperitech.
We meet usually the second (?) Wednesday of the month, at 7:00 PM.

Our next meeting is a little exception, since
it will be at the same time as Cambridge and Rome
events, see [Home](http://rustaceans.uk/). The location of this event will be **[Fusolab](http://www.fusolab.net/) (to be confirmed!)**, (**not** LUISS EnLabs as usual!).
 Please register [here](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Roma/events/242709171/).
