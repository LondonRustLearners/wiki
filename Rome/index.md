# Rome group

We meet up once a month at LUISS EnLabs, in the frame of Codemotion Aperitech.
We meet usually the second (?) wednesday of the month, at 7:00 PM.

Our next meeting is a little exception, since
it will be at the same time as Cambridge and Rome
events, see [Home](http://rustaceans.uk/).
