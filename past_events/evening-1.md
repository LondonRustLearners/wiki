# Rust learning and hacking evening #1

Monday January 30 at 6:30/7 PM at CodeNode, 10 South Place, London, EC2M 7EB. 

We will meet up from 6:30 PM for socializing and preparing and will start the official activities at 7 PM. We'll have to leave the space around 9:30 PM (so we don't have much time, really!)

The learning group will go through the chapters "Getting started" and as much of "Tutorial: Guessing Game" as we manage (except if everybody is further ahead already and we decide to jump forward). Christian will offer access to a server with Rust already installed for those who don't have it working on their own machine.

The attendants wanting to work on team projects will hold and listen to pitches on which projects they would like to or could work on and why those are suited, will build the teams, then start work.

Join the discussion on the Rust London User Group [meetup event page](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/events/237073865/), and please register for the event at [Skills Matter's event page](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/9012-rust-learning-and-hacking-evening-1).
