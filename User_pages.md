# User pages

Pages of individual members of this group, for things that may not be
immediately useful for everyone (to avoid cluttering up the common
space). This includes, for example, link collections. These pages are
listed to the right in the navigation (will become a submenu in the
future).

Don't be shy to create your own user page, just say "Create new file"
on the [Github
directory](https://github.com/LondonRustLearners/wiki/edit/master/users/).
