# Cambridge group

We meet up roughly once a month at [Cambridge Consultants, UK](https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com), usually from 6:30 PM
for a 7.00 PM start, to learn from guest speakers, and from each other, and to work on projects. Refreshments are provided by our hosts (and sometimes pizza too). You must register to attend each event on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Rust-Meetup/) as spaces are limited.

Our next meeting will be at the same time as Cambridge and Rome events, see [Home](http://rustaceans.uk/).
