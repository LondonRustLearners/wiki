# To do?

* Website

    * Christian: make the page index (at the top of the pages) hierarchical (I've code an implementation of this already, just need to update the code and check that nothing in the config breaks)
    * Christian: better handling of exceptions on faulty HTML markup in markdown pages

* Mailing list

    * do we actually want one? Public or private or both? 

* Choice of date, and feedback/ideas

    * Christian: I was planning to do a query form, but didn't manage to get that done.
