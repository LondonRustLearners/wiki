This is a list of ideas for projects suitable to work on in teams

these items, move it over to the [home](Home.md) page and mention the
team members or a leader or contact person.

* implementation of security sensitive system libraries and programs

    * DHCP client
    * various image decompressors
    * OpenVPN replacement

* work on parts of [Redox OS](http://www.redox-os.org/)
  ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10295187))
